  <p class="firsttext">It is essential that everyone should feel safe and included no matter who they are. My goal with this website is bring more awareness to the violence towards transgendered people because transgender lives are just as important as cisgender lives.</p>

  <p class="secondtext">Unfortunately, many reports of violence goes left unnoticed without any attention. One reason behind this is because of the lack of education and resources. So it is very important that the victims receive justice and have their voices heard.</p>
